This organisation supports four mesh adaptation tools for the [Firedrake finite element library](https://www.firedrakeproject.org/):

* [Animate](https://github.com/mesh-adaptation/animate) for metric-based mesh adaptation.
* [Goalie](https://github.com/mesh-adaptation/goalie) for goal-oriented error estimation and mesh adaptation.
* [Movement](https://github.com/mesh-adaptation/movement) for mesh movement ($r$-adaptation) methods.
* [UM2N](https://github.com/mesh-adaptation/um2n) for data-driven mesh movement methods.

The organisation also supports a [docs](https://github.com/mesh-adaptation/docs) repository, which provides install information and source for the [website](https://mesh-adaptation.github.io/).
